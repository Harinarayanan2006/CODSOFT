Departing Annapolis, MD in a scrappy old 27-foot fiberglass sloop without fanfare, 30-year-old Rutherford braved the icebergs of the arctic and mountainous waves of Cape Horn to become the only person to ever sail single-handed, non-stop around the Americas; a 27,000 mile journey many professional sailors declared \"a suicide mission.\" As a youngster, Matt's ADHD and tics made life at home and at school near-impossible. At age 13 he was in drug rehab and he spent his remaining teen years more on the streets than in school. Then, at age 17, locked up in a cell, he had an epiphany and decided to turn his life around. Matt attended and excelled at a special high school for troubled youth where he developed a desire to explore the world. After graduating, he bought his first sailboat - sight unseen on the Internet. Over the next few years he bought boats on the cheap, fixed them up, and learned to sail on the fly. In 2008, Matt embarked on a single-handed voyage from the USA to Europe, West Africa and back across the Atlantic to the Caribbean. He'd found his calling. In 2011, Matt took on his biggest challenge: a solo, nonstop circumnavigation of the Americas. He did it for himself, and to raise money for disabled sailors. After 309 days at sea, Matt achieved his goal and sailed into Annapolis to a hero's welcome. Matt's story is told through his own words and interviews with his family, sailing experts, and others. We use family photos and video of his childhood; Matt's own footage of his early sailing days; and video, audio logs, and stills from his historic around the Americas voyage. To this we add additional ocean footage; archival visuals of earlier explorers Matt admires; and re-enactments from Matt's troubled past. Matt Rutherford's story is full of surprises. It is truly inspiring and makes us all feel we can do more than we ever imagined.\n",

Emir and his director are accused by the press of being like \"Borat in Bosnia,\" seeking to mock the town's believers. Emir's outlandish behavior grows more excessive and confused, culminating in a grandiose shoot at the summit of the Moon Pyramid that descends into chaos. He is taken into the heart of the Pyramid of the Sun, where he is forced to confront his beliefs. Where does fact end and fiction begin? How do you make the film of a pyramid that can't be seen? This is a story of the power of faith, imagination and community, and of the futility of looking for absolute truths, in life, and in movies.\n",

A series of vignettes involving radio personalities is intertwined with the life of a working class family in Rockaway Beach, NY circa 1942. A man reminisces about his youth, growing up in the 1930s and 40s in New York. We see and hear stories of himself, his parents, neighbours and friends and local celebrities. The common denominator in all the stories and in the overarching plot is the presence of the radio - it brought music, news, stories, escape and comfort, made stars of everyday people and was often the glue in families and relationships. Joe, a New York Jew, fondly recalls his growing up period in the late 1930s and early 1940s in Rockaway, Queens. He not only lived with his parents - his father who would not divulge his occupation to Joe - but also with his mother's extended family out of financial necessity. That family consisted of biological aunts, an uncle by marriage, his grandmother and a cousin. Each member of the family had his or her routine - such as his cousin Ruthie listening to the neighbors' goings-on through the telephone party line - which grounded the activities. With the diversity of those activities, what tied the family together was listening to the radio. While the adults listened to a variety of talk shows and game shows - the former often providing an escape of being able to peer into the lives of the rich and famous - Joe loved the serials, and would have done anything to get a Masked Avenger secret decoder ring, the 15-cents which he didn't have to send away for it. Joe also recalls the back stories of some of the players in the New York radio scene, one in particular, Sally White, who wanted desperately to become a radio star, who worked as a cigarette girl at a Broadway club where many radio personalities hung out, and who was saddled with a non-radio Brooklyn accent. The radio also was the conduit for breaking news, some on a global scale - such as the US entering the war following the bombing of Pearl Harbor - and some more on a personal scale, both which nonetheless kept the listener glued to the radio for the outcome. But what everyone listened to was the music, especially his single Aunt Bea who wanted to get married but who always seemed to attract the wrong type of man. Joe still places certain songs from the era with certain events in his and his family's lives. But with each passing year, those memories become less pronounced in his brain. Several generations of a family packed into a pre-War Rockaway house always have the radio on. The fearless Masked Avenger, breakfast-show socialites (and philanderers) Roger and Irene, and Sally the Cigarette Girl are almost important as, say, whether the Pacific is a better ocean than the Atlantic, or even what your dad actually does for a living.\n",

            "‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping malformed line 6978: 6978 ::: Unlikely Heroes of the Arab Spring (2014) ::: documentary ::: Presented by the award-winning author and property-rights activist Hernando de Soto, this public television special presents, for the first time, the basic human and economic events that led to the Arab uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. The program shows that \"The Arab Spring\" was less a political event than it was about the coming of the industrial revolution to a region where over 90% of the population lives and works outside the rule of law. De Soto shows us that this informal economy is, however, the one common thread that can contribute to the region's growth and stability. Amid provocative images of the Arab uprisings of 2010 and 2011, De Soto introduces the people and events that recently rocked the Arab world, sparked by the self-immolation of the poor, 26 year old street vendor, Tarek Bouazizi. It was not the $225 lost from his fruit cart, expropriated by the police, that transformed young Bouazizi into a martyr and a symbol of the revolution - it was his similarity to the 180 million informal Arab entrepreneurs; many of them under 30 and computer literate. Over 100 of them followed Bouazizi in acts of self-immolation. The history of business in the Arab world is highlighted in sequences from Morocco, and the program demonstrates how business is thriving along with Arab culture in the international business city of Istanbul. Traveling through the region, De Soto summarizes, \"Throughout the Middle East the story is the same. As the industrial revolution comes to the Middle East, the true path to stability rests in the region's single common denominator: the informal marketplace. The Arab consensus ahead is about more than emancipating the entrepreneurial spirit; it's about resolving the institutional deficiencies that make most Arabs desperately poor.\"\n",

We follow their lives and tribulations as everyone converges on a regular basis at Montreal's hot disco spot: Starlight. Along the way, several events take place that change these characters' lives. As these characters' lives unfold, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois takes power changing the cultural landscape in Quebec while the disco craze slowly fades. While we keep up with these various characters - it is Bastien who is a central part of this story. His drug addiction, dreams to become an actor and womanizing - make him the \"bigger than life\" typical 70s character around which the whole story revolves. It's 1976, disco is king and the Starlight its primary palace in Montr√©al. Bastien Lavall√©e is the hottest guy in town, a radio DJ and the host of Disco Dance Party, the \"it\" show on television. Bastien used to be a serious actor, until these new gigs became his and his family's meal tickets. Bastien's abandonment of his original dreams, his excesses (especially of cocaine) fueled by this success and his sly neglect of his admiring daughter Cynthia Lavall√©e is much to the chagrin of his wife Connie Lavall√©e. The discotheque is owned by Daniel Lefebvre, an astute businessman, but its purchase was financed by his father, the domineering Gilles Lefebvre, a record producer, from under whose control Daniel can't seem to get out. Another star on the Montr√©al disco scene is Jonathan Aaronson, the openly gay trend-setter and trend reporter on Disco Dance Party. Into this world come Tina and Tino, a couple on and off the dance floor, they who won a dance contest at the Starlight, which results in them becoming the hot new couple on Disco Dance Party. Tino is fighting his own battles behind the scenes, both external ones with his mother about the family restaurant business, and internal ones about his hidden homosexual orientation which he denies to himself. The hedonism of the time is epitomized by Adriana, a beautiful but basically talentless woman who can get whatever she wants because of her looks, and if she sleeps with the right people. Conversely, Mimi, one of Gilles' former clients, is on a downward career path as her francophone sound isn't \"disco\". Those strongly connected to disco music are seemingly unstoppable in whatever they want in life and Montr√©al seems destined to be a part of this bright future. But four years later, as the province's governing Parti Qu√©becois holds a sovereignty referendum, as past shady deals come to the surface, as disco starts to fade in favor of new wave music, and as what would eventually be known as the AIDS crisis begins, things look a little differently for this group and their futures.\n",

In another incident that follows, Shyam, a drug addict and a resident of the apartment building in which Pranav resides, commits suicide due to a failed relationship. Pranav understands from a depressed old man that suicide is \"freedom from all worries.\" These incidents create an indelible mark in the mind of Pranav, who thereafter threatens Jackie that he would commit suicide if he was not getting a divorce from his parents.

            "‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping malformed line 7104: 7104 ::: \"Chasing the Sun\" (2001) ::: documentary ::: This 4-part documentary mini-series traces the development of commercial passenger aviation in the 20th century, from the Wright Brothers to the Concorde and beyond. In episode 1, \"Heroes and Daredevils\" rule the skies after the Wrights invent the first controllable powered airplane. Air travel is expensive, dangerous, and slow. Air mail becomes the big money-maker for the fledgling airlines after World War I. Passengers are not a priority--if there is room, they sit among the bags of mail. The public's interest in air travel is piqued by the adventures of Charles Lindbergh and the writings of his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, perhaps the most well-known airplane passenger. In episode 2, \"The Visionaries\" develop new aircraft and build the infrastructure for worldwide air travel. Designers and engineers such as Donald Douglas, the Lockheed brothers, Jack Northrop, and William Boeing construct larger, faster, and safer airplanes, while airline executives such as Juan Trippe of Pan American and Jack Frye of TWA put together an expanding network of air routes, often with monopolies granted by the U.S. government. Traveling by air becomes an option for more and more people. Episode 3, \"Into the Jet Age\", profiles Frank Whittle's invention of the gas turbine (jet) engine and the resulting revolution in passenger aviation. Large jets such as the Boeing 707 bring air travel to the masses, although ticket prices are still relatively high. The supersonic Concorde is built by Britain and France, but fails to make money for the airlines--the future does not lie in that direction. Episode 4, \"All Aboard\", charts the final evolution of air travel from the province of the rich to affordable mass transportation, and looks at the problems that lie ahead. New jumbo jets help to relieve airport congestion and enable more and more people to fly. The U.S. government de-regulates the airline business in 1978, allowing airlines to set their own routes and prices. This brings about much lower airfares, but many airlines are unable to compete and go out of business. The airplane manufacturers, too, fall into difficult economic times--today only two companies make large passenger jets: Boeing and Airbus. And with the great increase in flights, the antiquated air traffic control system again struggles to keep up.\n",

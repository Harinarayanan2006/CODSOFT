# 🖋️ Task 5 – Handwritten Text Generation using RNN

🎯 **Final Task** from my Machine Learning Internship at **CodSoft**

This project builds a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that learns patterns from poetic text and generates handwritten-style text — one character at a time ✍️

---

## 📌 Objective

- Use deep learning to generate new poetic lines.
- Train a GRU-based RNN on the **Gutenberg Poetry Corpus**.
- Generate text using learned patterns in character sequences.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras 🧠
- NumPy 🔢
- NDJSON Preprocessing 📄
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

## 📝 Sample Output

```
The sky was full of stars and fire,
A song beneath the winds’ desire.
With silver threads, the night was spun,
Until the rise of morning sun...
